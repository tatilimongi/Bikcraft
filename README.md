This repository contains the code for Bikcraft, a project focused on demonstrating responsiveness and accessibility principles in web design.

## Accessibility Features

- **Semantic HTML Elements**: Implemented semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for better accessibility and screen reader compatibility.
- **Descriptive Alt Attributes**: All images include descriptive `alt` attributes to provide alternative text for screen readers, enhancing accessibility for visually impaired users.
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Ensured all interactive elements are keyboard accessible and focusable, improving usability for users who rely on keyboard navigation.
- **Color Contrast**: Checked and adjusted color contrast ratios to ensure text readability for users with visual impairments.

## Responsiveness Implementation

- **Media Queries**: Utilized media queries in the `style.css` file to create responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes and resolutions.
- **Responsive Images**: Implemented CSS techniques to ensure images resize proportionally and maintain aspect ratio across different devices, enhancing the user experience.
- **Flexbox/Grid Layout**: Utilized CSS Flexbox and Grid layout for creating flexible and responsive page structures that adjust dynamically based on viewport size.

## Testing

The code has been thoroughly tested for accessibility using the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.
